## core concept: decentralized intellectrual collaboration

There are three levels of permissions to a project (classic) for people and teams:

   * Read, which gives people permission to view a project (classic).
   * Write, which gives people permission to view a project (classic), link repositories to a project (classic), and interact with a project (classic). For more information, see "Linking a repository to a project (classic).
   * Admin, which gives people permission to view a project (classic), interact with a project (classic), manage project (classic) settings, and manage other people's access to the project (classic).

Organization owners and people with admin permissions can give a person access to an organization project (classic) individually, as an outside collaborator or organization member, or through their membership in a team or organization. An outside collaborator is someone who is not an organization member but given permissions to collaborate in your organization.
